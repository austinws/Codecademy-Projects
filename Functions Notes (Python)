BASIC FUNCTION EXAMPLE

def square(n):
  """Returns the square of a number."""
  squared = n ** 2
  print "%d squared is %d." % (n, squared)
  return squared
  
# Call the square function on line 10! Make sure to
# include the number 10 between the parentheses.

square(10)

SOMETHING I GOT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SURPRISINGLY

def cube(number):
  return number ** 3

def by_three(number):
  if number%3==0:
    return cube(number)
  else:
    return False

IMPORTING LIBRARIES
#just imports the math library so python can print the square root of 25
import math
print math.sqrt(25)

#(from module import function) this is an easier way to do it if we just want to use sqrt and dont want to type math.sqrt
from math import sqrt
print sqrt(25)
