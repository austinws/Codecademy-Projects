BASIC FUNCTION EXAMPLE

def square(n):
  """Returns the square of a number."""
  squared = n ** 2
  print "%d squared is %d." % (n, squared)
  return squared
  
# Call the square function on line 10! Make sure to
# include the number 10 between the parentheses.

square(10)

SOMETHING I GOT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SURPRISINGLY

def cube(number):
  return number ** 3

def by_three(number):
  if number%3==0:
    return cube(number)
  else:
    return False
